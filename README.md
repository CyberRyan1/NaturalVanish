# NaturalVanish
NaturalVanish is a plugin intended to help your staff members watch players on the server.
One of the main ideas NaturalVanish was created with in mind was to have highly configurable
messages, as well as have highly configurable options. Some of these options include setting
the flight speed of vanished players, giving them night vision, and much more.

## FAQ
> What is the "see-self" option?

This just adds invisibility to the player, along with vanishing them. The intended purpose
of this is to allow vanished players to more easily tell if they are vanished or not.

> What is the "skull-head" option?

This only works if the "see-self" option is set to false. This sets the player's helmet
to their skull, meaking it easy to see where they are (only visible to players with vanish
levels higher than or equal to the player's level).

> I found a bug/I have a suggestion! Where should I put it?

If you found a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub, describe what the bug is, and add
the `bug` label, as well as what severity you think the bug is. For suggestions, the process
is similar to that of bugs, however please just add the `suggestion` label instead of 
the `bug` label.
